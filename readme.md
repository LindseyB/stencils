Stencils

All of the stencils are licensed under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

You can see examples of some of the stencils on [Caw Caw](http://cawcaw.herokuapp.com/). 


### Notes
- Most of the stencils are one stencil per folder, but a couple are multiple that are related
- Layers should be applied from low to high (e.g. layer 1 should be down first)
- PSD files **usually** have each of the layers as an all black layer occasionally with the desired color specified in the layer name (sometimes with additional layers showing the end result)
- Some are just kind of disorganized (these are usually single layer stencils, but not always)
